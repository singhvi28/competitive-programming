#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.

- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 3. Core Intuition & Problem Framing

* $E$: Edges of an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$.
* $\mathcal{I}$: Subsets of edges that contain **no cycles** (forests).
* *Bases:* Spanning forests (or Spanning Trees if $G$ is connected).
* *Circuits:* Simple cycles.
* *Greedy Algorithm:* **Kruskal's Algorithm**. Kruskal is literally the Rado-Edmonds greedy algorithm on a Graphic Matroid.

---

#### 4. Proof Sketches & Recurrences

* $E$ is partitioned into disjoint categories: $E = B_1 \sqcup B_2 \sqcup \dots \sqcup B_k$.
* Bounds $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_k$ for each category.
* $\mathcal{I} = \{S \subseteq E \mid |S \cap B_i| \le d_i \text{ for all } i\}$.
* *Problem Context:* "Select items of various categories, taking at most $d_i$ items of category $i$."

#### 6. Recognition Trigger Signals & Heuristics

- $E$: A set of vectors over a field $\mathbb{F}$ (e.g., $\mathbb{F}_2$ for XOR).
- $\mathcal{I}$: Subsets of vectors that are **linearly independent**.
- Circuits:* Minimally linearly dependent sets of vectors.
- Greedy Algorithm:* **XOR Linear Basis** (Gaussian elimination over $\mathbb{F}_2$).

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

> **Contest ROI:** B-tier | **Rating Range:** 1600–2200 | **Frequency:** Common

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

#### 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

##### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

##### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

##### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

##### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

##### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.
