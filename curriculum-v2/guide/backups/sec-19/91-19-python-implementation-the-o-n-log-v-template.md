## 2. Theoretical Deep-Dive & Mathematical Mechanics

### Overview

Greedy Fundamentals establish formal proof techniques and data structure invariants for greedy optimization: Exchange Arguments, Stays-Ahead Invariants, and Priority Queue Regret / Undo Maintenance.

### Fundamental Theorems & Invariants

- **Exchange Argument Theorem:** To prove greedy sorting criteria $A < B$ is optimal, assume an optimal solution violates the order. Show that swapping adjacent out-of-order elements cannot worsen the objective function.
- **Smith's Rule for Scheduling:** When scheduling $N$ jobs with processing time $p_i$ and weight $w_i$ to minimize weighted completion time $\sum w_i C_i$, sorting in descending order of $\frac{w_i}{p_i}$ is strictly optimal.
- **Regret / Undo Heap Invariant:** When choices cannot be verified greedily upfront, accept the current greedy choice optimistically; if constraints are violated later, undo the worst prior choice by popping from a priority queue.

### Algorithmic Execution Blueprint

1. **Deriving Exchange Condition:** Write objective for pair $(i, j)$ in order $i$ then $j$ vs $j$ then $i$. Cancel common terms to isolate sorting comparator `return w[i] * p[j] > w[j] * p[i]`.
2. **Regret Heap (e.g. Potions):** Iterate through events; add current item. If health becomes negative, pop and reverse the effect of the most punishing past item from `priority_queue`.

### Closed-Form Invariant Equations

$$\text{Exchange Condition}: \quad \text{Cost}(i, j) \le \text{Cost}(j, i) \iff \frac{w_i}{p_i} \ge \frac{w_j}{p_j}$$

### Structural Edge Cases & Assumptions

- Comparators passed to `std::sort` must satisfy Strict Weak Ordering ($a < a$ must return `false`).
- Greedy exchange arguments require pairwise independence; if choice $i$ alters the available choices for subsequent elements non-linearly, DP or flows are required.

### Python 3 Template

```python
import sys

def solve():
    # Example: Maximize value using exactly K items
    # Value function is concave (diminishing returns)
    
    def check(penalty):
        # This is your standard DP or Greedy but WITHOUT the K constraint.
        # Instead, every 'choice' costs 'penalty'.
        # Returns: (max_value, count_of_items_used)
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Option 1: Don't take item i
            # Option 2: Take item i (which costs 'penalty')
            # ... apply standard DP transitions here ...
            pass
            
        return dp[n], cnt[n]

    # Binary search for the slope (lambda)
    low = 0
    high = 10**14 # Max possible value
    best_lambda = 0
    
    # We want count to be >= K (for maximization)
    for _ in range(100): # Or while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        _, count = check(mid)
        if count >= k:
            best_lambda = mid
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
            
    val, count = check(best_lambda)
    # The true answer for K is: val + (best_lambda * K)
    # (Since we subtracted lambda*count in the DP, we add it back for K items)
    print(val + best_lambda * k)
```
